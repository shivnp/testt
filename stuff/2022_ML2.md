## Course Objectives:
This course aims at introducing the students to advanced topics in machine learning (ML). 
The course will begin with lessons on programming
which is needed to enable one to efficiently implement ML
algorithms.
The lectures will focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based assignments for implementation.

## References:
  This course will take excerpts from some standard books on machine
  learning and signal processing. But it will largely be based on
  articles and research papers in ML and SP conferences (e.g.,
  NeurIPS, ICML, Interspeech, ICASSP, etc.) and journals (e.g., IEEE
  TASLP, JMLR, IEEE PAMI, etc.).
